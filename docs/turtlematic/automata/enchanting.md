## Notes

??? "Enchantment power gathering"

    To perform enchantment you need to make sure, that you have enough enchantment power. Any head or bookshelf around turtle (radius of influence is 2 blocks) will give 2 extra points of enchantment power. Take a note, that turtles in the same radius will give two extra enchantment power points per enchanting book in their inventory.
