# Turtlematic

Turtlematic - is mod about making turtles so useful, so you will never need any other automation mod!

Most of peripheral methods are collected into API methods. Every new automata core, that you will craft expand or evolve those abilities by methods and parameters will stay the same!

    Soul vial recipe

To start with the main part of this mod, you need to obtain a Soul vial and start gathering souls. To collect soul you just need to right click on soul sand with this vial, it consumes soul and transform soul sand into usual sand. You can track soul consumption progress by tooltip and image picture. After enough soul it will be transformed into "Filled soul vial" that can be used to craft your first [automata](automata/automata.md)!

## Improving automata core

TBD
