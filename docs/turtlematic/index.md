# Turtlematic

Turtlematic - is mod about making turtles so useful, so you will never need any other automation mod!

Most of peripheral methods are collected into [APIs](./api.md) methods. Every new automata core, that you will craft expand or evolve those abilities by methods and parameters will stay the same!
